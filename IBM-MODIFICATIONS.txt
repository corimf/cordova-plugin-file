Add Android M Permission support
- Cordova RTC work item number: 106363
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: 
- Markmail or Google Group reference:
- Product PMR: APAR PI61332 (RTC 106363)
- Cherry-pick: No cherry-pick, backport cordova-plugin-file 4.2.0
- Full description: The Android M permission model will request for permissions at 
run time. To add this support, Cordova plugins will need to add permission request functions 
in Android API 23 to handle the run time permissions. The File plugin could not 
be easily backported, so the whole plugin's resources got upgraded for Android only. The 
upgrade does not affect the other platforms.
